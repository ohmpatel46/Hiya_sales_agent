# Hiya Sales Agent - AI Voice Sales Assistant

A fully functional AI sales agent that makes real phone calls, qualifies leads, and schedules meetings using voice AI technology.

## üéØ Customer Scenario

**Job to be Done**: "As a sales manager, I want to automate cold calling and lead qualification so that I can focus on closing deals instead of prospecting."

**Voice Value**: Natural conversation, works on any phone, handles interruptions, operates 24/7.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Custom Orchestration Framework** (`agent/orchestrator.py`)
   - Manages conversation state and tool execution
   - Handles session management and history tracking
   - Integrates with evaluation framework

2. **Sales Flow Engine** (`agent/flows/sales.py`)
   - Defines conversation logic and state transitions
   - Handles intent recognition and slot extraction
   - Manages meeting scheduling workflow

3. **LangChain/LangGraph Integration** (`agent/flows/langchain_sales.py`)
   - Alternative workflow using industry-standard patterns
   - StateGraph-based conversation management
   - Tool calling with LangChain tools

4. **Voice Integration**
   - **Vonage Voice API**: Real phone calls with NCCO control
   - **Speech-to-Text**: Vonage's built-in speech recognition
   - **Text-to-Speech**: SSML-enhanced voice responses

5. **External Integrations**
   - **Google Calendar API**: Event scheduling
   - **Google Sheets API**: CRM and lead management
   - **Tool Calling**: Clean abstraction for external services

6. **Evaluation Framework** (`agent/evaluation.py`)
   - Conversation quality metrics
   - Success rate tracking
   - Performance analytics

## üöÄ Features

- **Calendar Integration**: Schedules meetings in Google Calendar
- **CRM Integration**: Manages leads in Google Sheets
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Tracks conversation quality and success rates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and recovery
- **Webhook Management**: Handles call events and speech input

### üîÑ Alternative Workflows
- **Custom Framework**: Lightweight, maintainable, extensible
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: Industry-standard orchestration patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Foundational Models
- **LLM**: Ollama with Llama 3.2 (3B parameters)
- **STT**: Vonage Voice API speech recognition
- **TTS**: Vonage Voice API with SSML support

### Orchestration
- **Custom Framework**: Built for specific use case
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: Industry-standard patterns
- **State Management**: Session-based conversation tracking

### Integrations
- **Vonage Voice API**: Phone calls and webhooks
- **Google Calendar API**: Event scheduling
- **Google Sheets API**: CRM and lead management

### Evaluation
- **Custom Metrics**: Conversation quality, success rates
- **Performance Tracking**: Error rates, tool usage
- **Analytics**: Outcome distribution and trends

## üìä Evaluation Framework

The system tracks comprehensive metrics:

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of interested leads
- **Meeting Rate**: Percentage of scheduled meetings
- **Quality Score**: 0-10 scale based on conversation flow
- **Error Rate**: Technical issues and failures
- **Outcome Distribution**: Interested, not interested, callback, etc.

## üéØ AI Tool Usage

This project extensively leveraged AI coding assistants for:
- **Code Generation**: Initial implementation and boilerplate
- **Debugging**: Problem identification and solution development
- **Architecture Design**: System design and integration patterns
- **Documentation**: README, comments, and technical documentation

All AI-generated code was critically evaluated, tested, and adapted to fit the specific requirements.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp env_sample.txt .env
   # Fill in your API keys and credentials
   ```

3. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```

4. **Access the UI**
   - Streamlit UI: http://localhost:8501
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## üìà Performance

- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for voice interactions
- **Success Rate**: Tracks conversation outcomes
- **Reliability**: Handles webhook failures and retries
- **Scalability**: Session-based architecture supports multiple concurrent calls

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Advanced NLU**: Better intent recognition and slot extraction
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different conversation strategies
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Support multiple sales teams
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conversation sentiment analysis
- **Integration Expansion**: CRM systems, email automation

## üìù Presentation Highlights
